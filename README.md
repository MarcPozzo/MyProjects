# This Portfolio contains 3 projects


## Birds_Detection (adding in October 2020)

The puropose is to detect a maximum of birds in fields.
Birds eat seeds in fields and farmers loose a part of their harverst, that is why we want to detect them in order to make them run away.
Custom Convolutional Neural Networks was used such as Lenet, VGG16 or YoloV2.  

The picture below is an overview of the project where birds detect are represented with green squares.

If you want give a try with Yolo you can type :
- cd Birds_Detection/Demonstration
_ python3 inference.py
If you want more details about this project go to the README in Birds_Detection, I will explain the strategies I used





## Ashare (start in November 2019)

The goal is to develop  models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: 
- chilled water, electric, 
- hot water,  
- steam meters. The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe.
It refers to the kaggle competition for more details and to download data follow the link below:

## MovieRecommenderProject (start in Februar 2019)

I made a recommender engine proposing to a users the best movie(s) corresponding to its taste.
You have the possibility to rapidely try it in opening a terminal in MovieRecommenderProject/MovieRecommenderEngine and typing :
python3 Action_Engine.py
You should get something like that in your terminal :
