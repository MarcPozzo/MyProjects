# Files z1.1, z1.2, z1.3, zomm_0.9:1.3_flip, 6c_rob are pretrained models

#test_pre_trained_imagettes.ipynb models compute the models above with normal imagettes
#test_pre_trained_imagettes_bigger.ipynb compute the models above with imagettes 20% wider
#test_pre_trained_imagettes_by_folder.ipynb compute the models above seperately in each folder
