# Introduction

The puropose is to detect a maximum of birds in fields with a raspberrypi. This raspberrypi is connected to a camera taking a new picture every 12 secondes. 
Birds eat seeds in fields and farmers loose a part of their harverst, that is why we want to detect them in order to make them fear. 
Custom Convolutional Neural Network was used such as Lenet, VGG16 or YoloV2.

# Instruction for a quick try :
A test with YoloV2 is now available for a small sample of pictures. If you want to test it, make sure the libraries are installed with the required version see below :
- tensorflow=1.13.1
- Keras=2.2.4
- openCV=3.4.2

If Requirements are satisfied then type :
- cd Birds_Detection/Demonstration
- python3 inference.py


# Strategies and methods useds


2 methods types of method can be used :
1) Manually extract objects by images differences and then analyze extracted objects with neural network (for exemple VGG16, Lenet).
2) Use specialzed neural network which automaticaly extract objects and analyze them ( for exemple Yolo, RCNN, ...).  

## Manually extraction

For a given image when a bird has just appeared, if you make the substraction with this image and the previous one (when there was still no bird), an important differences will appear in the area of the bird. 
However several small differences may appear in other areas of the image if there are for example new shadows that form see the image below:

These square areas are extracted and then should be analyzed.
Below you can see in green the square areas predicted by Lenet CNN as birds and in blue the square areas not predict as a bird.

For our use case we only need to detect birds in fields, the rest of the picture is not useful this is why I a mask is set.


Before to set the mask

After to set the mask

## Model with automatic extraction

Now we are using YoloV2. Birds are represented by blue squares and a rabit is represented with green squares. the number above the squares represents the percentage of certainty of predicting the obtained class

We can notice that YoloV2 well trained can detect birds and other animals that a human can barely find ( see below the original picture).
