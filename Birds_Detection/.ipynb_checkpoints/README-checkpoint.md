The puropose is to detect a maximum of birds in fields with a raspberry pi. 
Birds eat seeds in fields and farmers loose a part of their harverst, that is why we want to detect them in order to make them fear. 
Custom Convolutional Neural Network was used such as Lenet or YoloV2.

Model_Results
Run VGG16, Lenet or Yolov2 and displays the number of birds find and the number of False Positive

Train : Train Different version of custom Lenet neural networks 

bin : script used by raspberry pi

Mat√©riels : data ressources such as tables, images, CNNs saved ... 

Research_and_optimization_of_parameters : search new parameter such as new classes, and try to find the best parameters for difference images 

Positionnement : script to switch positions in photo view to position in map view
Parameter_GPU : first explorations to make the GPU work
